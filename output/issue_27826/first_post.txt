## Summary

This has been enabled at Meta for some time, but it looks like the changes were never published here. Enables isInputPending at a `maxYieldMs` of 10ms. Removes `enableIsInputPendingContinuous` flag and its corresponding yield interval, as we ended up landing on a configuration where it never got used.

## How did you test this change?
