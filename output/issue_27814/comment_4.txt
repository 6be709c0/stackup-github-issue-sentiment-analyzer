Hello,
I'm Pushkar Thakur, a full-stack developer with two years of experience.  I liked your idea to add the LinkedIn link to the React website. I'm keen to contribute to this. Could you guide me on how I can start contributing? I'm excited to be part of the project.
I'm looking forward to your guidance on how I can start contributing. Thank you for your time and consideration.
