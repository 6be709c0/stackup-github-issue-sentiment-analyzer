## Summary

It is not possible to publish a third-party library Text/TextInput component that accepts raw text as children.
The function [createTextInstance][1] triggers an error if the name of the HostComponent is not one of those defined in [getChildHostComponent][2].

This PR adds one additional type to the react-native renderer to be used by third-party libraries (fixes https://github.com/facebook/react-native/issues/25136). 

#### Additional info on the motivations for this change

The react-native team previously suggested publishing react-native patches for Text and TextInput through a third-party library (https://github.com/react-native-community/discussions-and-proposals/discussions/731#discussioncomment-7821826).

The library [react-native-improved][5] provides react-native bug fixes without using patch-package or forking react-native. 

The project is currently a proof of concept and applies only one fix (PR https://github.com/facebook/react-native/pull/41770) to the react-native Text component, but more components and fixes could be published in the future. 

The advantages of this approach over forking react-native are the following:

[5]: https://github.com/fabriziobertoglio1987/react-native-improved

- The components are based on the react-native implementation (for ex. [ReactTextView][6], [ReactTextViewManager][6], and ReactTextShadowNode).  
- It is possible to add javascript, android and iOS patches
- No issues upgrading react-native
- The fixes can be used selectively in the application (for ex. by using `import { TextImproved } from 'react-native-improved'`)
- Allows a wider community to contribute to react-native
- May help make the release process of react-native easier in the future 
- Fast development workflow (building react-native from source with third party libraries may take 10-30 minutes)

## How did you test this change?

- I tested the solution with [patch-package](https://github.com/fabriziobertoglio1987/react-native-improved/blob/main/example/patches/react-native%2B0.73.0%2B001%2Bfix-renderer-text-runtime.patch) in the react-native-improved [example](https://github.com/fabriziobertoglio1987/react-native-improved/blob/main/example/patches/react-native%2B0.73.0%2B001%2Bfix-renderer-text-runtime.patch) 
- I tested the solution in a brand new react-native 0.73 app after installing react-native-improved npm package
