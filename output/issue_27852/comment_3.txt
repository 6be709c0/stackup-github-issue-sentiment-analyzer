Thank you for answering.

I install it as a package because in Ubuntu it comes as a *.deb file and therefore it is possible to install it separately as a package and build from source.

I see contacts of maintainers of the package. So I'll write them.
Maintainer: Debian Javascript Maintainers <pkg-javascript-devel@lists.alioth.debian.org>
Uploaders: Pirate Praveen <praveen@debian.org>

Thank you.
