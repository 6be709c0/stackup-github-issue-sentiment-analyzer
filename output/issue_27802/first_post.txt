## Summary

This pull request converts the CircleCI workflows to GitHub actions workflows. [Github Actions Importer](https://github.com/github/gh-actions-importer) was used to convert the workflows initially, then I edited them manually to correct errors in translation.  

**Issues**
1. facebook/react/publish_preleases_nightly  
The scripts that this workflow calls need to be modified. Repo secrets need to be in place.
