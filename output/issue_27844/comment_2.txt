Google Chrome Version 120.0.6099.110 (Official Build) (64-bit)
React Developer Tools Version 5.0.0 (12/5/2023)
Windows 11 Business Version 21H2, OS build 22000.2538

This happens on all pages.
Tried removing all other extensions, reloading page, reopening devtools, restarting chrome, reinstalling extension.
The only thing that works is incognito mode.
